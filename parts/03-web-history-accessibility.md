## A brief history of the web and web accessibility

### Web accessibility from the 90s to today

- Disability justice activists in the U.S. successfully
  lobby for legislation around web accessibility: Section
  508 becomes law in 1998

  - Similar regulation is made in Canada in 2011

- WCAG 1.0 (web content accessibility guidelines)
  published in 1999

  - one recommendation said that web developers should use
    HTML and CSS – and to do so according to the standards

  - this worried Macromedia (and later Adobe), the
    developers of Flash

- Many developers shifted focus to HTML, CSS and JS (and
  away from Flash)

  - while other options for creating web applications that
    were not tied to the "start-stop-start-stop" pattern
    of interaction on the web – like iframes or Flash –
    AJAX becomes the most popular

- WCAG 2.0 in 2008 no longer advises on which tech stack
  to use, instead the recommendations are about _how_ to
  make designs accessible regardless of stack

  - still, it seems like HTML5 and CSS3 have ultimately
    defeated Flash (likely also because Apple decided not
    to support Flash on iOS)

  - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is
    developed as a technology to complement
    standards-compliant HTML, CSS and JS

- The rapid growth of the mobile web posed (and poses) new
  challenges for web developers

- Also in 2008, the Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP)
  guidelines are published

  - many of its recommendations match up directly with
    WCAG 2.0 recommendations

  - Example: web experiences should be accessible across a
    wide range of devices, like destkop, mobile, TV, or
    screenreaders and other assistive technologies

  - Example: providing text alternative to non-text
    content, such as captions for videos, which benefits
    D/deaf people but also users in public spaces (like a
    loud street, or a quiet library)
