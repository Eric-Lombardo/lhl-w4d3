        <section>
          <p>Here's an introduction to the accesibility
          challenges when working with dynamic HTML:</p>

          <blockquote>
          Using JavaScript, it is possible to
          dynamically change parts of a page without
          requiring the entire page to reload â€” for
          instance, to update a list of search results on
          the fly, or to display a discreet alert or
          notification which does not require user
          interaction. While these changes are usually
          visually apparent to users who can see the page,
          they may not be obvious to users of assistive
          technologies. ARIA live regions fill this gap
          and provide a way to programmatically expose
          dynamic content changes in a way that can be
          announced by assistive
          technologies.

                Discovering dynamically updated content
                without page reload is one of the biggest
                obstacles for screen readers, especially
                in the days of Ajax, Node, and single-page
                applications. How should these be handled?
                Should the whole page be spoken again? Or
                should the [assistive technologies] do
                nothing, risking that the user will miss
                important updates?
              </p>

            <li class="post-comments__comment">
              <h4>Hora says:</h4>
